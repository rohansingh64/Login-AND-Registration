# Login-AND-Registration

This C++ program implements a basic user registration and login system. It features two primary functions:

1. **Registration:**
   - Prompts the user to enter a unique Login ID and a password with a minimum length of 8 characters.
   - Stores the credentials in a text file for later use.

2. **Login:**
   - Allows users to enter their Login ID and password to gain access.
   - Validates the entered credentials against the stored data and provides appropriate feedback.

The program uses file handling to save and verify user credentials, and includes basic error handling for file operations. It operates via a console interface, allowing users to choose between registration, login, or exiting the program.
